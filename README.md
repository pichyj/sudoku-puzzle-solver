# sudoku-puzzle-solver

Here are some sources that helped me create this sudoku puzzle solver:

[example default boards](https://sandiway.arizona.edu/sudoku/examples.html)
[online sudoku game](https://sudoku.com/)
[backtracking video](https://youtu.be/Zq4upTEaQyM)

The default board can be changed to anything with zeros representing empty spaces that need to be filled.
